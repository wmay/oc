
0.8	* Unusual polarity issues fixed

0.9     * HISTORY file added
        * Changes to fix issues with big matrix adapted

0.92	* Fixes mostly to comply with 2.14.1 R CMD CHECK
	* .onAttach() no longer calls require or uses cat()
	* INTEGER(8) to REAL(8) memory leak fixed
	* Rd documentation files now call \method markup, not full name
	* Note that the mini-plot functions, like plot.OCangles(), are not really S3 functions. The alternative was to use underscore instead of '.' in file name
	* Made a deliberate decision to cast them as S3 to maintain backward compatibility
	* Affiliations updated to represent current institutions
	* STOP statements taken out to remove compilation note
	* Extra graphic files deleted from inst/doc

0.95	* Updated all author institutional affiliations
	* Vignette moved to vignettes directory for R 3.1 compliance
	* .First.Lib use eliminated for R 3.1 compliance
	* HISTORY file renamed ChangeLog
	* Truncated Rd ddocumentation to not overrun PDF
	* Used a saved sen90oc file to reduce runtime on test examples

	* Period removed from title
	* importFrom() and S3 statements added to NAMESPACE

0.98	* Overhauled underlying FORTRAN code to be F95 compiliant	
	* added oc_init.c
	* Lower case for "Optimal Classification" in description
	* \dontrun{} used for examples
